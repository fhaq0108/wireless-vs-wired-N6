   <h2 id="w1"> What Is a Wireless Network?</h2>
   <p>A wireless local-area network (LAN) uses radio waves to connect devices such as laptops and mobile phones to the Internet and to your business network and its applications. When you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot at a cafe, a hotel, an airport lounge, or another public place, you're connecting to that business's wireless network.</p>
  
   <h2 id="w2">What is a wireless network vs. a wired network?</h2>
   <p>A wired network uses cables to connect devices, such as laptop or desktop computers, to the Internet or another network.

<p>A wireless network allows devices to stay connected to the network but roam untethered to any wires. Access points amplify Wi-Fi signals, so a device can be far from a router but still be connected to the network.</p>

<p>A wired network has some disadvantages when compared to a wireless network. The biggest disadvantage is that your device is tethered to a router. The most common wired networks use cables connected at one end to an Ethernet port on the network router and at the other end to a computer or other device.</p>

<p>Previously it was thought that wired networks were faster and more secure than wireless networks. But continual enhancements to wireless network technology and Wi-Fi networking standards have eroded speed and security differences between wired and wireless networks.</p>

<h2 id="w3">What are the benefits of a wireless network?</h2>
<p><strong>Convenience:</strong><br>
Access your network resources from any location within your wireless network's coverage area or from any Wi-Fi hotspot.<br></p>
<p><strong>Mobility:</strong><br>
You're not tied to your desk, as you are with a wired connection. You and your employees can go online in conference room meetings, for example.</p> 
       
<p><strong>Productivity:</strong><br>
Wireless access to the Internet and to your company's key applications and resources helps your staff get the job done and encourages collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Easy setup:</strong><br>
You don't have to string cables, so installation can be quick and cost effective.</p>
<p><strong>Expandability:</strong><br>
You can easily expand wireless networks with existing equipment, whereas a wired network might require additional wiring.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong><br>
Advances in wireless networks provide robust security protections.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong><br>
Because wireless networks eliminate or reduce wiring expenses, they can cost less to operate than wired networks.Convenience

<h2 id="w4">Disadvantages of a Wireless Network</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>It can require extra costs and equipment to set up, although increasingly routers have built-in wireless capability, as do devices such as laptops, handheld devices, modern DVD players, and TVs.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting up a wireless network can sometimes be difficult for people who are not experienced with computers. (Although there are issues with setting up a wired network too, off course!)
File-sharing transfer speeds are normally slower with wireless networks than they are with cabled. The speeds can also vary considerably according to your location in relation to the network.</p></li>
<li><p>The general speed of a wireless connection is also usually much slower than a wired one. The connection also gets worse the farther you are from the router, which can be a problem in a large building or space.</p></li>
<li><p>Wireless connections can be obstructed by everyday household items and structures such as walls, ceilings, and furniture.
Wireless networks are generally less secure. There can also be problems with neighbors stealing bandwidth, if the network hasn’t been set up to be password protected. Information is also less secure too and can be easier to hack into.</p></li>
