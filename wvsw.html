   <h1> What Is a Wireless Network?</h1>
   <p>A wireless local-area network (LAN) uses radio waves to connect devices such as laptops and mobile phones to the Internet and to your business network and its applications. When you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot at a cafe, a hotel, an airport lounge, or another public place, you're connecting to that business's wireless network.</p>
   
   <h1>What is a wireless network vs. a wired network?</h1>
   <p>A wired network uses cables to connect devices, such as laptop or desktop computers, to the Internet or another network.

<p>A wireless network allows devices to stay connected to the network but roam untethered to any wires. Access points amplify Wi-Fi signals, so a device can be far from a router but still be connected to the network.</p>

<p>A wired network has some disadvantages when compared to a wireless network. The biggest disadvantage is that your device is tethered to a router. The most common wired networks use cables connected at one end to an Ethernet port on the network router and at the other end to a computer or other device.</p>

<p>Previously it was thought that wired networks were faster and more secure than wireless networks. But continual enhancements to wireless network technology and Wi-Fi networking standards have eroded speed and security differences between wired and wireless networks.</p>
