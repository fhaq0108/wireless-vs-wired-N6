   <h1> Advantages of a Wireless Network over Wired</h1>
   <ul>
<li>As I mentioned in the introduction, the main advantage of a wireless network over a wired one is that users can move around freely within the area of the network with their laptops, handheld devices etc and get an internet connection.</li>
<li>Users are also able to share files and other resources with other devices that are connected to the network without having to be cabled to a port.</li>
<li>Not having to lay lots of cables and put them through walls etc. can be a considerable advantage in terms of time and expense. It also makes it easier to add extra devices to the network, as no new cabling is needed.</li>
<li>If you are a business such as a caf√©, having a wireless network that is accessible to customers can bring you extra business. Customers generally love wireless networks because they are convenient.</li>
<li>Wireless networks can sometimes handle a larger amount of users because they are not limited by a specific number of connection ports.</li>
<li>Instant transfer of information to social media is made much easier. For instance, taking a photograph and uploading it to Facebook can generally be done much quicker with wireless technology.</li>

</ul>
